This directory contains all necessary files to reproduce the docking benchmak in "A generative algorithm for de novo design of proteins with diverse pocket structures".

Due to the large number and size of files resulting from rotamer field generation (RIFGEN) and docking (RIFDOCK), they will be made available separately, or upon request.

Final summary files and python notebooks with data to reproduce the analysis presented in the publication are provided.
