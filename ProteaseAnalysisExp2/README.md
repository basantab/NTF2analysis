All PDB files for designs ordered for this experiment can be found in NTF2analysis/ProteaseAnalysisExp2/PDBs_from_ordered_designs.

The grc_* prefix stands for "glycine rescue control"
The tlc_* prefix stands for "tryptophan-lysine control"
The scr_* prefix stands for "scrambled control"

There are no PDB files available for the above controls, as they are generated by scrambling the design sequence and not modeled by Rosetta.
